def validate_token(refresh_url, exceptions=(), callback=None,
                   access_key='access_token', refresh_key='refresh_token'):
    ''' a decorator used to validate the access_token for oauth based
    data sources.
    This decorator should be used on every method in the data source that
    fetches data from the oauth controlled resource, and that relies on a
    valid access_token in order to operate properly.
    If the token is valid, the normal flow continues without any change.
    Otherwise, if any of `exceptions` tuple is raised, the normal flow
    will be preceded by the following steps:

    1. `refresh_url` will be called in order to refresh the token
    2. the newly refreshed token will be saved in the source
    3. the `callback` function will be called

    If the refresh fails for any reason, the user would have to re-grant
    permission for the application

    Parameters
    ----------
    refresh_url : str
        The URL to be called in order to refresh the access token.
    callback : str or callable
        A callback function to be called whenever the access_token is
        validated. The callback function would be called with the refreshed
        token as an argument.
        If the `callback` is not `callable`, but an `str` it will be called
        on `self` (i.e. call a method on your Data Source)
        Defaults to None
    exceptions : tuple
        A list of exceptions that should cause token revalidation
        Defaults to Exception, meaning that all errors will cause token
        refresh
    access_key : str
        The access token key as defined in the source and in the response from
        the refresh URL.
        Defaults to `access_token`
    refresh_key : str
        The refresh token key as defined in the source and in the request to
        the refresh URL.
        Defaults to `refresh_token`
